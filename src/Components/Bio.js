                                Name's Ollie, a self-taught acrobat of the treetops and a night-time ninja (or so I like to think). I'm a late bloomer in the animal kingdom fame game â€“ scientists only spotted me hanging out in the Andean cloud forests recently. Talk about being fashionably late to the party!

                                I spend most nights dining on a lavish spread of fruits (I'm a bit of a fig fanatic) and the occasional insect, because who doesn't like a bit of protein with their sweets? My hobbies include perfecting the art of the silent pounce, napping in tree hollows (they're like the five-star hotels of the forest), and composing songs that only other Olinguitos appreciate.

                                I'm a small package, but what I lack in size, I make up for in fluff. My fur coat is the envy of the forest; it's like wearing a cloud, only warmer. And speaking of clouds, I literally live in one. The misty cloud forest is my home, and I wouldn't trade it for the world. Well, maybe for a lifetime supply of berries...

                                Also, fun fact: I'm quite the tree whisperer. You'll often find me having deep, meaningful conversations with the local flora. They're great listeners, especially the ancient oaks.

                                I'm looking for a partner who doesn't want to spent time together. As an Olinguito, the most romantic thing I can think of is a partner who will mate with me and then rear our young to maturity while I get a little "me" time. Forever. I'm willing to share my fruit! But only if you bring your own fruit and you don't take any of my fruit. I am unwilling to share my fruit. I'm just a guy who wants to breed seasonally in the night and then retreat back to my figs and berries.
